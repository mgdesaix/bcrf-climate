# Ecological Niche Models (ENMs) in R

Observational data of Brown-capped Rosy-Finches were obtained from the citizen science database eBird (https://ebird.org/science/use-ebird-data/download-ebird-data-products). Detailed instructions for creating presence/absence data from eBird observations are provided [here](https://cornelllabofornithology.github.io/ebird-best-practices/ebird.html). All ecological niche modeling was performed in the R package `biomod2` (https://github.com/biomodhub/biomod2).

Code is provided for developing the ENMs ([current-ENMs-ddi.Rmd](./r-scripts/current-ENMs-ddi.Rmd)), automating projections across different future environmental data sets ([automate-ENMs-future-ddi.Rmd](./r-scripts/current-ENMs-ddi.Rmd)), and automating the maps of habitat suitability ([automate-ENM-figures-bcrf.Rmd](./r-scripts/automate-ENM-figures-bcrf.Rmd)).
