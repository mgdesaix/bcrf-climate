# bcrf-climate

Bioinformatics and analysis scripts for Brown-capped Rosy-Finch (*Leucosticte australis*) climate change project:

1.  [Data preprocessing](https://github.com/mgdesaix/bcrf-climate/blob/master/01_Preprocessing/Preprocessing.md): Includes trimming FASTQs, mapping to reference, merging, marking PCR duplicates

2.  [Variant calling](https://github.com/mgdesaix/bcrf-climate/blob/master/02_VariantCalling/Variants.md): Base quality recalibration, filtering high-quality SNPs

3.  [Population genetics things](https://github.com/mgdesaix/bcrf-climate/blob/main/03_PopulationGenetics/Popgen.md): Principal components analysis, relatedness, linkage disequilibrium, ancestry values, and more!

4.  [Genetic environment association analyses](https://github.com/mgdesaix/bcrf-climate/blob/main/04_GEA/GEA.md): Redundancy analysis (RDA), latent factor mixed models (LFMM), gradient forest, etc
